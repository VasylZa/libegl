BUG/TODO (Priroity)

TODO Priority List:
 - Moemory management C vs ObjC - dangling pointer ? use _weak and stuff
 - Mutex when locking ressources in eglCreateWindowSurface
 - "The first time a OpenGL or OpenGL ES context is made current the viewport and scissor dimensions are set to the size of the draw surface" in eglMakeCurrent
 - Add support for rotation ? Native Window Resizing
 - Add support for context lost
 - Replace MyFunctionNameFuncPtr into MYFUNCNAMEPROC 
 - contentScaleFactor == 1 ? IN EAGL_eglCreateWindowSurface

EGL:  several types of drawing surfaces collectively referred to as EGLSurfaces;
        - windows, used for onscreen rendering; 
        - pbuffers, used for offscreen rendering; 
        -  pixmaps, used for offscreen rendering into buffers that may be accessed through native APIs. 
        
        EGL windows and pixmaps are tied to native window system windows and pixmaps

EGLDisplay = the UIWindow holding our custom view 
EGLSurface = window surf: CAEAGLayer's attached to a sub-class from UIView 
             pbuffer surf (block of memory dynamically allocated on the graphics card, but not visible on-screen): OpenGL's Framebuffer Objects -> See https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/3ddrawing/conceptual/opengles_programmingguide/WorkingwithEAGLContexts/WorkingwithEAGLContexts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH103-SW6
             pixmap surf ( uses whatever pixel buffer representation is supported by the platformâ€™s native graphics API (in the case of Android, this would be a Bitmap), allowing you to mix and match OpenGL and native graphics drawing calls into the same pixels without having to copy buffers back and forth): CGContextRef from Quartz 2D
